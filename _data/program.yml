      title: "Cloud about the clouds"
      abstract: "Currently, a mere 20% of data processing and analysis occurs locally, with a dominant 80% centralized in data centers. However, this paradigm is shifting. Predictions indicate that within five years, edge computing will handle the majority of data processing and analytics. This trend is driven by the escalating demand for real-time data access and the need to manage the burgeoning data volumes generated at the network's edge, exemplified by Earth Observation Services. Integrating edge computing into space platforms brings processing closer to data generation, significantly reducing communication bottlenecks and accelerating data analysis. This approach alleviates the data load transmitted to Earth, enabling faster decision-making and response times. Extending this concept, space edge computing can evolve into a robust space cloud infrastructure, facilitated by high-speed interconnectivity and distributed computing frameworks. This platform would offer in-space computing resources and services, fostering flexible data sharing and task distribution. Beyond basic edge computing, it could support complex data analysis and storage, providing large-scale computing services that complement terrestrial cloud infrastructure. This presentation will delve into the concepts of space edge and cloud computing, exploring the inherent challenges and the transformative opportunities they present."
