    talk:
      title: "LEOs in 2024: Space Lasers, Policies, Coverage, and Connectivity"
      abstract: "Over 7,000 satellites are now in low Earth orbit (LEO) with 10s of thousands more planned over the next few years. Where is this all going? High-speed, low-latency connectivity is changing people's lives and helping connect so many of the unconnected, but at what cost? What are the opportunities and the challenges with providing Internet access from space? Two years ago the Internet Society published a perspective on the state of the LEO-based Internet access industry. In this session, Dan York will look at all that has happened over the past two years in terms of technology and policy, and also the many lingering issues and areas where more research is needed. He'll explore the major barriers for operators and the new opportunities such as direct-to-device. There is huge potential for systems in LEO to bring the Internet to more people - if we are okay with the tradeoffs!"
