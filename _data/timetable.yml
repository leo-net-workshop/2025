He received his PhD on runtime support for quality of information requirements in event-based systems from TU Darmstadt before re-joining industry in various leadership positions.<br/>In his current role at Infront, Sebastian is fostering transparency, simplification, and automation regarding, systems, processes, and roles across the Infront group. While this might sound to be completely detached from his former areas of interest it is actually the direct application of his research, as Infront is doing event-processing at scale for a living. He is also still actively engaging in joint research activities and looking for interesting collaboration topics between industry and academia.<br/>Please do not hesitate to get in touch with Sebastian (e.g., via the DEBS 2021 Slack channels) regarding collaboration opportunities or career options at Infront -- there might be more topics of mutual interest than you think."

#         abstract: "Blockchain-based smart contract platforms have traditionally em- ployed the transaction-driven execution model. This paper presents an alternate framework for blockchain-based smart contract execu- tion called EDSC. Our platform design presents a novel approach to tackle the scalability and performance challenges facing the smart contract ecosystem. We base EDSC’s design on the Ethereum tem- plate, and it can be readily implemented for other existing smart contract platforms. To evaluate our design, we perform an experi- mental implementation using the Ethereum client. Our experiments with performance modeling show, on average, a 2.2 to 4.6 times reduced total latency of event-triggered smart contracts, demon- strating the effectiveness of the design in supporting time-sensitive applications. Additionally, we comment on the design’s potential security aspects and demonstrate its utility by discussing potential use cases."

#         authors: 'Roy Friedman, Rana Shahout'
#         abstract: "Answering statistical queries about streams of online arriving data is becoming increasingly important. Often, such data includes multiple-attributes, so data elements can be viewed as points in a multi-dimensional universe. This paper extends existing works on streaming algorithms by studying the ability to perform box queries on online multi-dimensional data streams. We develop three algo- rithms C-DARQ, DARQ and MARQ that support such capabilities for a large number of statistical functions including (but not limited to) counting, frequency estimation, heavy-hitters etc. The protocols are analyzed and evaluated over synthetic and datasets from Kaggle in multiple dimensions (up to 8). Our algorithms asymptotically improve the space bounds as well as update and query performance of existing works. Unlike known approaches, our algorithms can also be used to solve a larger class of problems beyond counting. We further discuss extending our work to the sliding window model and when the dimensions’ bounds are a-priori unknown."

#       - title: Fast Recovery of Correlated Failures in Distributed Stream Processing Engines
#         authors: 'Li Su, Yongluan Zhou'
#         abstract: "In a large-scale cluster, correlated failures usually involve a number of nodes failing simultaneously. Although correlated failures occur infrequently, they have significant effect on systems’ availability, es- pecially for streaming applications that require real-time analysis, as repairing the failed nodes or acquiring additional ones would take a significant amount of time. Most state-of-the-art distributed stream processing systems (DSPSs) focus on recovering individual failures and do not consider the optimization for recovering correlated failure. In this work, we propose an incremental and query-centric recovery paradigm where the recovery of failed operator partitions would be carefully scheduled based on the current availability of resources, such that the outputs of queries can be recovered as early as possible. By analyzing the existing recovery techniques, we identify the challenges and propose a fault-tolerance framework that can support incremen- tal recovery with minimum overhead during the system’s normal execution. We also formulate the new problem of recovery schedul- ing under correlated failures and design algorithms to optimize the recovery latency with a performance guarantee. A comprehensive set of experiments are conducted to study the validity of our proposal."

#       - title: Distributed Transactions on Serverless Stateful Functions
#         authors: 'Martijn de Heus, Kyriakos Psarakis, Marios Fragkoulis, Asterios Katsifodimos'
#         abstract: "Serverless computing is currently the fastest-growing cloud services segment. The most prominent serverless offering is Function-as-a- Service (FaaS), where users write functions and the cloud automates deployment, maintenance, and scalability. Although FaaS is a good fit for executing stateless functions, it does not adequately sup- port stateful constructs like microservices and scalable, low-latency cloud applications, mainly because it lacks proper state manage- ment support and the ability to perform function-to-function calls. Most importantly, executing transactions across stateful functions remains an open problem.<br/>In this paper, we introduce a programming model and implemen- tation for transaction orchestration of stateful serverless functions. Our programming model supports serializable distributed trans- actions with two-phase commit, as well as relaxed transactional guarantees with Sagas. We design and implement our programming model on Apache Flink StateFun. We choose to build our solution on top of StateFun in order to leverage Flink’s exactly-once processing and state management guarantees. We base our evaluation on the YCSB benchmark, which we extended with transactional operations and adapted for the SFaaS programming model. Our experiments show that our transactional orchestration adds 10% overhead to the original system and that Sagas can achieve up to 34% more transactions per second than two-phase commit transactions at a sub-200ms latency."

#       - title: A Distributed Database System for Event-based Microservices
#         authors: 'Rodrigo Laigner, Yongluan Zhou, Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles'
#         abstract: "Microservice architectures are an emerging industrial approach to build large scale and event-based systems. In this architectural style, an application is functionally partitioned into several small and au- tonomous building blocks, so-called microservices, communicating and exchanging data with each other via events.<br/>By pursuing a model where fault isolation is enforced at mi- croservice level, each microservice manages their own database, thus database systems are not shared across microservices. Developers end up encoding substantial data management logic in the application-tier and encountering a series of challenges on enforcing data integrity and maintaining data consistency across microservices.<br/>In this vision paper, we argue that there is a need to rethink how database systems can better support microservices and relieve the burden of handling complex data management tasks faced by programmers. We envision the design and research opportunities for a novel distributed database management system targeted at event-driven microservices."
